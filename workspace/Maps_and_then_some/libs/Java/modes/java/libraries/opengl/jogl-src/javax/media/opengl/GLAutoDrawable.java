    an event based mechanism ({@link GLEventListener}) for performing
    OpenGL rendering. A GLAutoDrawable automatically creates a primary
    rendering context which is associated with the GLAutoDrawable for
    the lifetime of the object. This context has the {@link
    GLContext#setSynchronized synchronized} property enabled so that
    calls to {@link GLContext#makeCurrent makeCurrent} will block if
    the context is current on another thread. This allows the internal
